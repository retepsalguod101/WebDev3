                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Street Fighter, is a fighting video game franchise developed and published by Capcom. The first game in the series was released in 1987, followed by five other main series games, as well as many various spin-offs and crossovers, as well as numerous adaptations in various other media. Its best-selling 1991's Street Fighter II is credited with establishing many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre. Street Fighter is one of the highest-grossing video game franchises of all time and serves as the company's flagship series.</p>
                <p>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior was released in 1991, and was the first true sequel to the original Street Fighter. This release followed an unsuccessful attempt to brand the 1989 beat 'em up game Final Fight and the officially commissioned spin-off Human Killing Machine as Street Fighter sequels.It was one of the earliest arcade games for Capcom's CP System hardware and was designed by Akira Nishitani and Akira Yasuda, who were also responsible for Final Fight and Forgotten Worlds.</p>
                <p>Street Fighter II is the first one-on-one fighting game to give players a choice from a variety of player characters with different moves. The choice of multiple available characters allows for more varied matches. In this game, each player character had a unique fighting style with approximately 30 or more moves, including then-new grappling moves and throws, as well as two or three special attacks per character. In the single-player mode, the player's chosen character is pitted sequentially against the seven other main characters before confronting the final four boss opponents, who consist of CPU-controlled characters not selectable by the player. As in the original, a second player could join in at any point during single player mode and compete against the other player in competitive matches.</p>
